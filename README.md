<h3> 🌺 About Me </h3>
        <p>
       I am a software developer passionate about solving complex problems and creating scalable solutions. My journey in technology has given me a strong connection to both software and hardware, and I love exploring new technologies to enhance my projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy listening to music, playing and exploring new games, and when I'm not coding, you can find me binge-watching my favorite series or trying out new games. Always ready to tackle the next challenge.
